    "reasoning": "The dominant use of natural wood, the presence of shoji screens, and the low table with floor seating are all strong indicators of Japanese Zen style, which is typically minimal and prioritizes simplicity, calmness, and natural materials. The uncluttered articulation, absence of excessive decorative items, and use of negative space reinforce both the Japanese Zen and Minimalist design styles, hence the high confidence scores for both. The balance and harmony conveyed by the arrangement also suggest a focus on mindfulness and tranquility distinctive to Japanese Zen interiors."

The dominant use of wood and natural light, along with the low-profile furniture and tranquil ambiance, contribute to a strong Japanese style, so confidence is very high. Minimalism is also evident due to the uncluttered space, simple forms, and focus on function, though it is slightly less dominant compared to the overt Japanese influences."

The overall restraint in decor, the open vertical space, and the focus on simplicity also suggest a strong minimalist influence. The confidence for Japanese is higher due to the distinct lighting elements, while minimalism is present as a complementary style."
